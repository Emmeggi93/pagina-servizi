        <h2>Pompeii</h2>
        <p>If you are asking how to go to Pompeii, we definetly say "by train". 
            From Sorrento train station to Pompeii it is just 40minutes, the ticket is around 4€ and the stop is right in front the gate of the ruins.
            It is possible to buy the ticket online, through the TicketOne circuit (Official seller).  
            It is also possible to buy the ticket at the entrances, and at the self service ticket offices.
            Pompeii is a proper city largely preserved under the ash, frozen at the moment it was buried.
            Now it is a very large site to discover, you could visit it multiple times and not yet see everything.
            For this reason we suggest you to go there for more then just one/two hours and be part of a guided tour, or at least rent audioguides at the ticket desk.
            Guided tours can be booked at the Information desk in Piazza Esedra and Piazza Anfiteatro entrance
