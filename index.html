<img src="immagini/capri.webp" alt="Capri Island">">
<div class="card-content">
<h2>🏝️ Capri</h2>
<p>

Ferries: From Sorrento port there is a ferry leaving about every half an hour, the ticket costs around 22€ one way.<br><br>

<!-- AMALFI -->
<div class="card">
<img src="immagini/positano.webp" alt="Amalfi Coast">
<div class="card-content">
<h2>⛰️ Amalfi Coast</h2>
<p>
For Amalfi Coast we mean Amalfi, Positano, Praiano, Ravello. It is quite impossible to visit them all in one day, so maybe pick max 3 of them (my personal top 3 is Positano, Ravello and Amalfi).<br><br>

These villages are all on the same road, one after the other, and there is no train station.  
So the only ways to get there are by boat or by road.<br><br>

By Road:<br>
Buses: they leave from Sorrento train station, ticket is not expensive but the road is very winding, so choose this if you don't usually get sick.<br><br>

Car Tour: A tour with a private car and an English speaking driver costs around 450€ (depending on number of people). It lasts 8 hours, you can choose the stops with him.<br><br>

Car Transfer: If you need just a transfer to one of these places (one way) it is from 150/200€.<br><br>

By Boat:<br>
Ferries: There are ferries leaving from Sorrento Port that take you to Positano or Amalfi, tickets cost around 20€ each.<br><br>

Group Tours: DA INSERIRE<br><br>

Private Tour: With a private small boat (just you and the pilot), 8h tour, free to choose the time to get off, all the explanations just for you, it costs around 1200€. For more info contact me.

<!-- NAPLES -->
<div class="card">
<img src="immagini/napoli.webp" alt="Naples">
<div class="card-content">
<h2>🏛️ Naples</h2>
<p>
Visiting Naples is always a good idea. You can get there by train, ferry or car.<br><br>

By Train: reach Sorrento train station, every train will take you to Naples, it is the very last stop and the ticket costs 4,60€.<br><br>

By Ferry: reach Sorrento Port and take the first ferry to Naples, the ticket costs around 15€ and it takes 45 min.<br><br>

By Taxi: ask us to book a taxi for you, prices are from 150€ (depending on people and time).<br><br>

Here our suggestions about things to see:<br>
Historical center<br>
Cappella San Severo with the Veiled Christ<br>
Naples Underground<br>
Cloister of Santa Chiara<br>
Piazza Plebiscito and the Royal Palace<br>
Archaeological Museum
</p>

<!-- POMPEII -->
<div class="card">
<img src="immagini/pompei.jpg" alt="Pompeii ruins">
<div class="card-content">
<h2>🏺 Pompeii</h2>
<p>
If you are asking how to go to Pompeii, we definitely say "by train".<br><br>

From Sorrento train station to Pompeii it is just 40 minutes, the ticket is around 4€ and the stop is right in front of the gate of the ruins.<br><br>

It is possible to buy the ticket online through the TicketOne circuit (official seller).  
It is also possible to buy the ticket at the entrances and at the self-service ticket offices.<br><br>

Pompeii is a proper city largely preserved under the ash, frozen at the moment it was buried.  
Now it is a very large site to discover, you could visit it multiple times and not yet see everything.<br><br>

For this reason we suggest you to go there for more than just one/two hours and be part of a guided tour, or at least rent audio guides at the ticket desk.<br><br>

Guided tours can be booked at the Information desk in Piazza Esedra and Piazza Anfiteatro entrance.<br><br>

<div class="card">
<img src="immagini/aereoporto.jpg" alt="Airport transfer">
<div class="card-content">
<h2>✈️ Airport Transfers</h2>
<p>
If you need a transfer to/from the airport we suggest you to inform us as soon as you can.<br><br>

Cars here are not so easy to find, there is a high demand and we can provide you the best price we find.<br><br>

Prices change depending on number of people, day or nighttime, high/low season.
